# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

A quick guide to the basic principles of OOP with clear explanations and examples.
*Suitable for educational projects, documentation or reference materials.*

## ðŸ“Œ Basic Principles

### 1. **Encapsulation** -> https://github.com/wako8o/OOP/tree/main/07_encapsulation_lab
Hiding data and behavior in objects, providing controlled access through public methods.

*Example:* Private attributes in classes.

---

### 2. **Inheritance** -> https://github.com/wako8o/OOP/tree/main/05_inheritance_lab
Creating new classes that inherit characteristics from existing (parent) classes.

*Example:* Child class `Cat`, inheriting from `Animal`.

---
### 3. **Polymorphism**
A single interface for different forms of implementation.

*Example:* Method `speak()`, returning different results for `Dog` and `Bird`.

---
### 4. **Abstraction** ->

Hiding the complex implementation and showing only the essential features.

*Example:* Abstract class `Shape` with method `calculate_area()`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Applications
OOP is used for:
- Better code organization.
- Reusability through inheritance.
- Easy maintenance and extension.
