# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

A quick guide to the basic principles of OOP with clear explanations and examples.
*Suitable for educational projects, documentation or reference materials.*

## 📌 Basic Principles

### 1. **Encapsulation**
Hiding data and behavior in objects, providing controlled access through public methods.
*Example:* Private attributes in classes.

### 2. **Inheritance**
Creating new classes that inherit characteristics from existing (parent) classes.
*Example:* Child class `Cat`, inheriting from `Animal`.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
A single interface for different forms of implementation.
*Example:* Method `speak()`, returning different results for `Dog` and `Bird`.

### 4. **Abstraction**
Hiding the complex implementation and showing only the essential features.
*Example:* Abstract class `Shape` with method `calculate_area()`.

## 🎯 Applications
OOP is used for:
- Better code organization.
- Reusability through inheritance.
- Easy maintenance and extension.
